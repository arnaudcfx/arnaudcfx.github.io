    <h1>HeroTrainer – Object-Oriented Mobile RPG Game</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>HeroTrainer</strong> is a role-playing game (RPG) developed as part of the <strong>Object-Oriented Programming on Mobile Devices</strong> course. It is a mobile and desktop-friendly game where users can train, equip, and battle with heroes of different classes. Each hero evolves over time through combat, item crafting, and trading with merchants. The project was built to demonstrate strong <strong>object-oriented design principles</strong> and a modular architecture for scalable game development.
    </p>

    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Loading Screen:</strong> Entry point where the player starts the game.</li>
      <li><strong>Select Screen:</strong> Players choose among nine hero classes, each with unique abilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Home Screen:</strong> Central hub for saving progress and navigating between screens.</li>
      <li><strong>Craft Screen:</strong> Allows merging of compatible items to create stronger ones.</li>
      <li><strong>Merchant Screen:</strong> Shop where players can buy or sell items from their inventory.</li>
      <li><strong>Hero Screen:</strong> Displays hero stats, equipment, and inventory.</li>
      <li><strong>Combat Screen:</strong> Turn-based battle interface where players fight monsters using attacks, potions, or spells.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Design</h2>
    <p>
      The game’s architecture is divided into four main layers, ensuring clean separation of responsibilities and easy maintainability:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Entities:</strong> Contain data structures and object models such as heroes, monsters, items, and spells.</li>
      <li><strong>Business Logic:</strong> Implements gameplay mechanics and communicates with UI through the Provider pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Developed using Flutter/Dart for a responsive, animated mobile interface.</li>
      <li><strong>Services:</strong> Manage saving, loading, and other device-related operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Object-Oriented Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The entire codebase follows <strong>object-oriented principles</strong>. The core class <code>Character</code> serves as an abstract base, defining shared attributes and methods for both heroes and enemies. Derived classes extend functionality through polymorphism, implementing unique combat behaviors, spells, and level-up logic. This architecture enables scalability and simplifies debugging and maintenance.
    </p>

    <h2>Combat & Items System</h2>
    <p>
      The turn-based combat system uses event-driven states to handle player and enemy actions. Each character can perform attacks, cast spells, or use items within time constraints. Effects like poison, armor boosts, and burn damage can persist over multiple turns, creating complex strategies. Items such as weapons, armor, and potions are procedurally generated based on hero level and rarity, allowing dynamic gameplay and replayability.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations & Future Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiplayer mode was planned but not implemented.</li>
      <li>Automatic game saving and expanded crafting options (alchemy, forging) could enhance experience.</li>
      <li>Future updates could include unique hero equipment, improved balancing, and additional sound effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies & Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dart & Flutter</strong> – Cross-platform mobile app framework for UI.</li>
      <li><strong>Java</strong> – Backend logic and data model implementation.</li>
      <li><strong>Makefile</strong> – For build automation and dependency management.</li>
      <li><strong>OOP Patterns</strong> – Abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism for game logic.</li>
      <li><strong>Git / GitHub</strong> – Version control and collaborative development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>HeroTrainer</strong> successfully demonstrates the use of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> and <strong>mobile game architecture</strong>. The project reinforced skills in software design, event-driven systems, and collaborative coding while producing a fully playable, animated RPG experience.
